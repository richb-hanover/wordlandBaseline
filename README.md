## Caveats
- This theme was designed to be the beginning theme for WordLand-authored WordPress sites. The goal is to get the minimal features for a nice blog-oriented site running in WordPress.
- The theme only shows the home page (all posts in reverse chronological order) and single posts.
- The home page shows all posts in an infinite scroll.
- It hides comments, sharing links, like buttons, and related posts, even if activated in WordPress or Jetpack.
- Other page types (archives, category pages, tag pages, custom pages, etc.) are not supported. Custom menus are not supported.
- Future releases will support the activation and configuration of additional WordPress features.
