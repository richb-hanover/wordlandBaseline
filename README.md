# WordLand Baseline theme for WordPress

A WordPress theme under development for [WordLand](https://wordland.social/). It is
inspired by the [Retrospect](https://wordpress.com/theme/retrospect)
theme by Automatic. Retrospect is distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 or later.

WordLand Baseline has only been tested on a self-hosted WordPress site and
not at wordpress.com. When finished it will become a full-fledged WordPress theme.

## How to use while under development

1. Download and install the Wordland Baseline theme
   - Download as a Zip file with the "Code" buttom at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline)
   - Upload to your site under Appearance > Themes > Add Themes > Upload Theme
   - Activate WordLand Baseline from Appearance > Themes

WordLand Baseline is now a stand-alone theme and no longer depends on Retrospect. It is currently a classic theme,
but will be converted to a block theme in the future. It does not yet support all features of WordPress.
