		<p>This is a list of things that I want to try out on the new baseline theme.</p>
		<p>Here are five great MLB first basemen and what made each of them especially interesting:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Lou Gehrig -- The "Iron Horse" of the Yankees, famous for his durability, humility, and <a href="https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/baseball-history/lou-gehrig-luckiest-man">tragic early retirement</a> due to ALS, which now bears his name.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pujols">Albert Pujols</a> -- A modern legend known for his all-around hitting, consistency, and longevity, finishing with over 700 home runs.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Willie McCovey -- Towering lefty slugger for the Giants, feared for his monstrous power and iconic presence in the batter's box.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Hernandez">Keith Hernandez</a> -- Brilliant defensively, redefining how first base was played with range, quickness, and leadership -- also a memorable personality.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Frank Thomas -- "The Big Hurt" dominated the '90s with his intimidating size and incredible hitting eye, combining power with patience.</p>
			</li>

		<h3>Italian pasta!</h3>
		<p>Now three short paragraphs to see what they look like when not inside a list element.</p>
		<p>Italian pasta comes in hundreds of shapes and varieties, from long strands of spaghetti to tube shaped penne to stuffed ravioli. Each region of Italy has its own traditional pasta dishes, with northern regions favoring egg pasta often served with cream based sauces, while southern regions prefer dried pasta paired with tomato sauces and seafood. The key to authentic Italian pasta lies in cooking it al dente and using fresh, simple ingredients that complement rather than overwhelm the pasta itself.</p>
		<p>Pizza originated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples">Naples</a> as a simple flatbread topped with tomatoes, but has evolved into countless regional variations throughout Italy. Traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza">Neapolitan pizza</a> features a soft, thin crust with minimal toppings of San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and olive oil, cooked quickly in extremely hot wood fired ovens. Roman pizza, by contrast, has a thinner, crispier crust, while Sicilian pizza is characterized by its thick, rectangular shape and hearty toppings.</p>
		<p>Italian cuisine celebrates seasonal ingredients through antipasti, small appetizers that showcase the bounty of each season. These may include marinated vegetables, cured meats like prosciutto and salami, and regional cheeses such as Parmigiano Reggiano, Pecorino, and fresh mozzarella. Antipasti exemplify the Italian approach to dining, where meals are unhurried social experiences meant to be savored over several courses, accompanied by local wines that complement the flavors of each dish.</p>
